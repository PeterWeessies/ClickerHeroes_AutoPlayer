# ClickerHeroes AutoPlayer
An autoplayer for the game Clicker Heroes (http://clickerheroes.com). It can autoclick, activate skills, buy heroes and upgrades, and ascend, and start all over.
This app is not tested with any other version of clicker heroes like Kongregate. Turn on show individual hero dps, and always use scientific notation when using this tool.

## Getting started
The first thing to do is setting the location of your clicker heroes game:

1. Go to Setting -> Clicker Heroes Position
2. Press Set
3. Hover your mouse over the highlighted corners, starting with top left, and press spacebar
4. Continue until all corners are set, and you get an confirmation it is saved.

Or if you are running a Windows client (e.g. Steam)

2. Press Detect. We'll ask Windows to find the right area for us.

In order for Salvage to work, you must uncheck the option show relic found popups.

## Setting the task list
The most important thing of this application is the task list. Using this task list you can specify what you want it to do.
The main command in here is [hero id], [amount], [upgrades], [wait], [verify] for example 27, 100, 3, false, true
